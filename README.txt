Filmapp (clapper.ca) is a tool for managing week-based budgeting in the film industry and tracks purchases, 
crew rentals, and labour against an estimated budget for each film set in the show. 

Key Features:
-   Users can create multiple estimate versions, choose which one they want to use to compare to the actual
    cash spent so far in the show, and compare estimate versions to see the changes since the last estimate version

-   The app is an excel-like format. It has cell-style navigation and interface, and allows copying and pasting 
    into and out of google sheets and excel for easy integration with existing informal spreadsheet systems that 
    permeate the non-standardized film industry.

-   The app has the ability to upload a template timesheet .xlsx file, and use it to generate a workbook of timesheets
    for each crew member in the show for a given week. 

-   The app has an access profile feature, which allows users to restrict columns, rows, and pages from being viewed or edited 
    by other users.
