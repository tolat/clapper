        1.  Sets can be removed from mongoose schema and just be an array of objects in estimate versions (DONE)
        2.  Make sheet not sort by number by default, but keep whatever sorting the page was saved on (NOT DONE)

        3.  Change weeks array to be indexed by the week number instead of having 'number' field (DONE)
        4.  Purchases, Positions can be just an array of objects in the show (not mongoose schema) (DONE)

        7.  Add option to be able to choose directly the comparison version (instead of 'previous version'). allow alpha-numeric

            if this is paired with a limited position list and allUser data based on access profil, data will be safe.

TODO:

1. Grid Mechanics
-   Auto save option (more like auto backup so if page is left without saving it has most recent verision. deleted when saved.)
-   Add sort by field on page loading (saves sort column instead of loading and sorting by number always) - default col is num col
-   if required for save field is left blank in crew page and save clears the row, the clear is not pushed to the undoredo buffer!
-   Add validation for column naming
-   Delete timesheets from db once they hvae been saved to local storage

2. Timesheets (99% DONE - could add more features)
    -   Block sort by column on timesheets cols

3. Styling Toolbar (Get cell styles to presist through grouping events)
    Need to add updates to styles when:
        -   Grouping is changed
        -   Sorting
        -   adding and removing rows
        -   Attach styles to the item id not the row

4. Permission based access
    -   display settings need to be moved into the access profile, as well as department colour and order.
    -   Figure out how to limit things like fringes, manday rate, multipliers
    -   Add access profile functionality to all pages
    -   Create interface for adding/editing access profiles
    -   Estimate version needs to be part of access profiles as well


5. Audit Page for Indivicual crew members -> rows are days worked, cols are show, set, hours, position

6. Change Purchases and rentals to weekly rentals and purchases+rentals (add columns for is Rental)

6. Make available offline

    Alternative: create feature where app can be exported as an excel workbook.
    To upload, add a feature for each show to upload data from an excel workbook show

    Use system where a script is downloaded that installs mongodb if not already installed, and runs the app locally after cloning the most 
    recent online database. then when desired the user can upload the changes to the master online database -  this would work best paired with
    a desktop app that can be used to do the database changing/uploading/downloading, it just uses the browser to do the rendering.
    EDIT: the whole app could be run as a desktop app, just online and offline and other settings are chosen from the desktop app, but the app
    rendering is done using the browser. Then app can be used as a web app on mobile etc., but can also be downloaded as a desktop app for offline use
    when needed. Allow user to download individual shows for offline use. then when updating, just update all master db objects associated with that show.
